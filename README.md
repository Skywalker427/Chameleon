### *Detect light and dark background colours with machine learning.*

A common UI and typography problem is detecting dynamic backgrounds as light or dark and setting the foreground text to an appropriate visible colour.

This application uses a machine learning model built on the brain.js library to identify the background and switch the foreground to the appropriate colour.
